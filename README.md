## Description
A demo of creating a 3d scatter parametric curve and line graph.

The parametric curve is defined by its corresponding parametric equations: x = f ( t) and y = g ( t) within a given interval. Parametric curves highlight the orientation of each set of quantities with respect to time. In the rectangular coordinate system, we are limited to defining functions, y = f ( x), that pass the vertical line test.
